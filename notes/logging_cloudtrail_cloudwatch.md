# AWS Logging Basics — My Notes

## CloudTrail
- Records AWS API activity (who did what, when, from where)
- Used for auditing, investigations, and detecting suspicious actions

## CloudWatch
- Used for monitoring (metrics, alarms) and collecting logs from resources/apps
- Helps with operational visibility and alerting

## One sentence summary
CloudTrail tells me "what actions happened in AWS", while CloudWatch helps me "monitor systems and collect logs/metrics".
